I reached out to a friend to join me since it is going to be quick\n          the extensive project. We've built prototypes in InVision and had\n          these MVP ideas approved. We currently are in development of the\n          buying process flow and have it 90% working (excluding actual customer\n          and clothing data)!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Next steps are to resolve our Buying flow and integrate this with\n          their current peripherals, like receipt printer, cash drawer, label\n          maker, scan gun, etc. After that we may be able to integrate into\n          their store's local database and begin integrating it into everyday\n          use while we develop the selling process. Wish us luck!\n        </p>\n      </>\n    }\n  />\n);\n\nexport default POSSystem;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/POSsystem-e7a116f65e721077dc7a6eda9cde143e.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/POScustomers-70507119beca0481eff320e3f4f108ed.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
