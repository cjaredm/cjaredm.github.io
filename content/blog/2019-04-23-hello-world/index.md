Hello World! Just figured out how to setup a Gatsby Blog. Firs attempt at using gatsby.
I unfortunately tried to do it the hard way, not using the start-blog they have. Got several errors with GraphQL not finding the markdown files... lame!
So I restarted with the starter-blog and it was up and running crazy fast.

I know this still looks like the same start-blog everyone has with Gatsby but I'll come back and
restyle it later.
