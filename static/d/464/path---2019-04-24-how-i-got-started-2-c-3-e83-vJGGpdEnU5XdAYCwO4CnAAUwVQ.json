It was fun!\nLearned to think more logically and get new perspective… BUT didn’t get me a job. Still fun though.</p>\n<p>After that I got married, had a kid and decided that maybe… maybe I should do something to\nmake enough money for a family.</p>\n<p>I loved learning and wished I could just keep going to college etc. So what I decided was to\nget a master’s degree in Educational Technology, also known as Instructional Design. I’d be\nable to create trainings, on everything. So I’d keep learning everything as I made different\nthings for different people. In fact I did some freelancing for awhile and made trainings for\npest control technicians, an online MBA program in Australia, and a cooking course in an\napplied technical college.</p>\n<p>BUT… alas that didn’t last long. It seems that most people in my cohort in my MEd. program\nalready had a job in training and were getting education to move up in their company.</p>\n<p>While I spent a bunch of money I didn’t have… again, to get that MEd.\n\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/657f690df4d8e1a36ca27641ffc78917/e2288/studentloanmeme.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 104.84374999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Get A Job meme\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/657f690df4d8e1a36ca27641ffc78917/c739e/studentloanmeme.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/657f690df4d8e1a36ca27641ffc78917/8ee9c/studentloanmeme.jpg 148w,\n/static/657f690df4d8e1a36ca27641ffc78917/ebbe7/studentloanmeme.jpg 295w,\n/static/657f690df4d8e1a36ca27641ffc78917/c739e/studentloanmeme.jpg 590w,\n/static/657f690df4d8e1a36ca27641ffc78917/e2288/studentloanmeme.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>I also was working for Apple doing tech support part time. Eventually I did that full time… and grew to… dislike\nit, to put it in nice words. It wasn’t hard, but it was boring and I didn’t fit the culture at the time. Wasn’t very\nfulfilling (to me that is). I was even getting anxious and stomach aches thinking about going\nto work. Dreading it every day. I wanted and needed to get out of there.</p>\n<p>During all that time I was messing around with spreadsheets and getting deeper and deeper in\nGoogle App Script making silly things. Made a spreadsheet with birthdays that a script would\ncheck every day around 7 AM, and text a special message I wrote to the birthday person. Super\ncool, huh? I also made a spreadsheet script for emailing people to remind them when their\nlease was ending, their new lease amount and other templated information.</p>\n<h4>The Moment</h4>\n<p>So I was having fun doing that and getting stomach aches before going to work at a dead end\njob. Then BAM! My friend Kasey saw what I was doing with spreadsheets and scripts and pushed\nme to learn how to code. My wife and I talked about it and I convinced her to go to work full\ntime while I paid a baby sitter to watch the kids while I learned how to code with some\nguidance from my friend.</p>\n<p>About 4 months later I won! I got a job with my friend’s company because I convinced them I\nwasn’t a jerk and was a fast learner. YAY! There was probably some other technical stuff I\nshowed them too, but yeah. I did it!</p>\n<h4>Now</h4>\n<p>Fast forward to now, 2 year later. Learned a ton more. I’m building React Native apps along\nwith all the other normal, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, PHP, and blah or whatever. I’ve also\nfound that I want to help other people. I started looking for people to help and mentor into\nJavaScript. It has been fun! Met some nice people and have really enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>I’ve been looking for more ways to help mentor others and keep learning. This blog will talk\nabout it. Keep checking in.\n\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/80f3fa8695fea9d0a4f6771204458a1b/8d2b4/iareprogrammermeme.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 474px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 74.68354430379746%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAFM16ozDRF//8QAGxABAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDABIUITH/2gAIAQEAAQUC8c2XHHO66FjKR48Z/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH/2gAIAQMBAT8BR//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABwQAAIBBQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhEhIjJhgv/aAAgBAQAGPwJwUteXZdU8lWSjfLIo5PrN2f/EAB0QAQACAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQWFxgfH/2gAIAQEAAT8hChXmGZ1K/c0oi7DuqiZcX6eIoqN0ZZ82f//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQpw//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEf/aAAgBAwEBPxBT/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQBB/9oACAECAQE/EJHL/8QAHBABAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBYYFR/9oACAEBAAE/EEL3EWhqz3x1FqAFh7Puo2qdByvCXkbgvCva4YrE3A9N5g5kvM//2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Get A Job meme\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/80f3fa8695fea9d0a4f6771204458a1b/8d2b4/iareprogrammermeme.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/80f3fa8695fea9d0a4f6771204458a1b/8ee9c/iareprogrammermeme.jpg 148w,\n/static/80f3fa8695fea9d0a4f6771204458a1b/ebbe7/iareprogrammermeme.jpg 295w,\n/static/80f3fa8695fea9d0a4f6771204458a1b/8d2b4/iareprogrammermeme.jpg 474w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How I Got Started","date":"April 24, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-04-24-how-i-got-started/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019-04-23-hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}},"next":null}}
