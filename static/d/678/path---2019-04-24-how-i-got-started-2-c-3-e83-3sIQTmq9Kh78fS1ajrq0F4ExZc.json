Got sick, literally sick, at my job and\ndecided it was time to figure something out. A friend mentored me and within 4 months I got my first dev job!</p>\n<h4>Extended History</h4>\n<p>I spent a bunch of money I didn’t have and received a BA in Philosophy. It was fun!\nLearned to think more logically and get new perspective… BUT didn’t get me a job. Still fun though.</p>\n<p>After that I got married, had a kid and decided that maybe… maybe I should do something to\nmake enough money for a family.</p>\n<p>I loved learning and wished I could just keep going to college etc. So what I decided was to\nget a master’s degree in Educational Technology, also known as Instructional Design. I’d be\nable to create trainings, on everything. So I’d keep learning everything as I made different\nthings for different people. In fact I did some freelancing for awhile and made trainings for\npest control technicians, an online MBA program in Australia, and a cooking course in an\napplied technical college.</p>\n<p>BUT… alas that didn’t last long. It seems that most people in my cohort in my MEd. program\nalready had a job in training and were getting education to move up in their company.</p>\n<p>While I spent a bunch of money I didn’t have… again, to get that MEd. I also was working for\nApple doing tech support part time. Eventually I did that full time… and grew to… dislike\nit, to put it in nice words. It wasn’t hard, but it was boring and I didn’t fit the culture at the time. Wasn’t very\nfulfilling (to me that is). I was even getting anxious and stomach aches thinking about going\nto work. Dreading it every day. I wanted and needed to get out of there.</p>\n<p>During all that time I was messing around with spreadsheets and getting deeper and deeper in\nGoogle App Script making silly things. Made a spreadsheet with birthdays that a script would\ncheck every day around 7 AM, and text a special message I wrote to the birthday person. Super\ncool, huh? I also made a spreadsheet script for emailing people to remind them when their\nlease was ending, their new lease amount and other templated information.</p>\n<h4>The Moment</h4>\n<p>So I was having fun doing that and getting stomach aches before going to work at a dead end\njob. Then BAM! My friend Kasey saw what I was doing with spreadsheets and scripts and pushed\nme to learn how to code. My wife and I talked about it and I convinced her to go to work full\ntime while I paid a baby sitter to watch the kids while I learned how to code with some\nguidance from my friend.</p>\n<p>About 4 months later I won! I got a job with my friend’s company because I convinced them I\nwasn’t a jerk and was a fast learner. YAY! There was probably some other technical stuff I\nshowed them too, but yeah. I did it!</p>\n<h4>Now</h4>\n<p>Fast forward to now, 2 year later. Learned a ton more. I’m building React Native apps along\nwith all the other normal, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, PHP, and blah or whatever. I’ve also\nfound that I want to help other people. I started looking for people to help and mentor into\nJavaScript. It has been fun! Met some nice people and have really enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>I’ve been looking for more ways to help mentor others and keep learning. This blog will talk\nabout it.
