# So you forgot how to do this?

## Installation

1. git clone `the-address-for-this-repo`
2. `git checkout develop && yarn`
3. Content is managed in Strapi, hosted in Heroku.
4. Images are managed by Cloudinary.
5. Stage, commit, push, etc.
6. `yarn deploy` will deploy the build to cjaredm.github.io.
7. `git push heroku master` will push to Heroku and build it there, which requires a Strapi server running, not locally.

The End!
