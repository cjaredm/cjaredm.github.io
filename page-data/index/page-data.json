Don't be a stranger, feel free to reach out and say hello!\n[jared@cjaredm.com](mailto:jared@cjaredm.com?subject=Just%20saw%20your%20portfolio%20site)\n\nI am someone who takes things apart to see how each part works. I am a life-time learner with a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy and a Master's degree of Eduction in Instructional Design. I strive to learn how things work while also focusing on functionality and getting work done.\n\nMy passion is to create value in the world. I am rewarded when I see my work being used, appreciated and built upon. I one day wish to own my own SaaS company that provides tools for small businesses. I dream to hire and train young adults in software development and mentor others seeking the same rewarding career I already have.","email":"jared@cjaredm.com","siteName":"cJaredm"},"defaults":{"postImage":{"publicURL":"/static/f80269153379c1038dc706360665c483/57ccb0e75a8f98e0f484c17e2122f0fd.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/f80269153379c1038dc706360665c483/f836f/57ccb0e75a8f98e0f484c17e2122f0fd.jpg 200w,\n/static/f80269153379c1038dc706360665c483/2244e/57ccb0e75a8f98e0f484c17e2122f0fd.jpg 400w,\n/static/f80269153379c1038dc706360665c483/14b42/57ccb0e75a8f98e0f484c17e2122f0fd.jpg 800w,\n/static/f80269153379c1038dc706360665c483/47498/57ccb0e75a8f98e0f484c17e2122f0fd.jpg 1200w,\n/static/f80269153379c1038dc706360665c483/0e329/57ccb0e75a8f98e0f484c17e2122f0fd.jpg 1600w"}}}},"posts":{"nodes":[{"id":"Blog-posts_7","strapiId":7,"route":"/blog/wordpress","title":"Wordpress?","synopsis":"CMS is important for clients, Wordpress isn't the best.
