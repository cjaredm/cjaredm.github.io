They don't only sell clothing, they also buy it from their customers, and from other wholesalers. Consignment POS systems have traditionally been used but almost all stores misuse them or hack them into a mangled mess. This will solve all reseller POS problems. You're welcome!","description":"Resellers buy and sell with their customers and currently there is no efficient method that works with the business model. Some consignment POS systems work but only so much. They all fall short and are out of date.\n\nHow do I know this? My neighbor owns over 9 clothing resell franchises. He has looked for years, tried multiple demos and currently prefers an OLD software that is quickly becoming obsolete and crashes their local databases so bad some days they just have to reset it and loose that days data... ðŸ˜¬\n\nAfter some meetings to collect the exact usage of their current software, a wish-list of bug fixes and new features I decided to build it. I reached out to a friend to join me since it is going to be quick the extensive project. We've built prototypes in InVision and had these MVP ideas approved. We currently are in development of the buying process flow and have it 90% working (excluding actual customer and clothing data)!\n\nNext steps are to resolve our Buying flow and integrate this with their current peripherals, like receipt printer, cash drawer, label maker, scan gun, etc. After that we may be able to integrate into their store's local database and begin integrating it into everyday use while we develop the selling process. Wish us luck!","techStack":[{"name":"React Native","url":"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/09a31ed59b78c1d34190105782c6168c/69585/a4581a7e4ce2add638f6dac695d14d02.png 200w,\n/static/09a31ed59b78c1d34190105782c6168c/497c6/a4581a7e4ce2add638f6dac695d14d02.png 400w,\n/static/09a31ed59b78c1d34190105782c6168c/46604/a4581a7e4ce2add638f6dac695d14d02.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"Apollo","url":"https://www.apollographql.com/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/ba6dfe05b28769f937a31f2adc58b1f2/69585/2100e7b23003bef1b7e9faf12a24ee69.png 200w,\n/static/ba6dfe05b28769f937a31f2adc58b1f2/497c6/2100e7b23003bef1b7e9faf12a24ee69.png 400w,\n/static/ba6dfe05b28769f937a31f2adc58b1f2/46604/2100e7b23003bef1b7e9faf12a24ee69.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"GraphQL","url":"https://graphql.org/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/dec2e9f1757366fd74825ed55cd5c47b/69585/f6ce5acd92674621c682a8b233a60bcc.png 200w,\n/static/dec2e9f1757366fd74825ed55cd5c47b/497c6/f6ce5acd92674621c682a8b233a60bcc.png 400w,\n/static/dec2e9f1757366fd74825ed55cd5c47b/46604/f6ce5acd92674621c682a8b233a60bcc.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"NodeJS","url":"https://nodejs.org/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/d43829d681d40a9e68e98b22ee867ebf/69585/544f74075eedfcce767a6da3f9640f3b.png 200w,\n/static/d43829d681d40a9e68e98b22ee867ebf/497c6/544f74075eedfcce767a6da3f9640f3b.png 400w,\n/static/d43829d681d40a9e68e98b22ee867ebf/46604/544f74075eedfcce767a6da3f9640f3b.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"Github","url":"https://github.com/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/fc5fa5f62c48204ce315a79ef9bce630/69585/637c695817abe2b5bf3e6ea7e9ba7817.png 200w,\n/static/fc5fa5f62c48204ce315a79ef9bce630/497c6/637c695817abe2b5bf3e6ea7e9ba7817.png 400w,\n/static/fc5fa5f62c48204ce315a79ef9bce630/46604/637c695817abe2b5bf3e6ea7e9ba7817.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"Styled-Components","url":"https://www.styled-components.com/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/e00eec81194bcabc024fc4a7376ae3c0/69585/2e1d44510f2cd92c45fbc1cc2c48e1bc.png 200w,\n/static/e00eec81194bcabc024fc4a7376ae3c0/497c6/2e1d44510f2cd92c45fbc1cc2c48e1bc.png 400w,\n/static/e00eec81194bcabc024fc4a7376ae3c0/46604/2e1d44510f2cd92c45fbc1cc2c48e1bc.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"TypeScript","url":"https://www.typescriptlang.org/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/cca052b9f1bd5f34efa5b66d6e5e4cf0/69585/28f7b92fd153402632fb43d810045d7e.png 200w,\n/static/cca052b9f1bd5f34efa5b66d6e5e4cf0/497c6/28f7b92fd153402632fb43d810045d7e.png 400w,\n/static/cca052b9f1bd5f34efa5b66d6e5e4cf0/46604/28f7b92fd153402632fb43d810045d7e.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"Prisma","url":"https://prisma.io/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/1832b339780ced00b6e8d0fdf921ff78/69585/e251540749600b45f1a134d20a074193.png 200w,\n/static/1832b339780ced00b6e8d0fdf921ff78/497c6/e251540749600b45f1a134d20a074193.png 400w,\n/static/1832b339780ced00b6e8d0fdf921ff78/46604/e251540749600b45f1a134d20a074193.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"React","url":"https://reactjs.org/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/09a31ed59b78c1d34190105782c6168c/69585/7f204f0ca8e0828d2a2f7c78229431aa.png 200w,\n/static/09a31ed59b78c1d34190105782c6168c/497c6/7f204f0ca8e0828d2a2f7c78229431aa.png 400w,\n/static/09a31ed59b78c1d34190105782c6168c/46604/7f204f0ca8e0828d2a2f7c78229431aa.png 500w"}}}}],"screenshot":{"name":"9ba9883f598f37bd84fb6890ea4d354f","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/a981d624617884c8c1ebaf18a8f4db22/69585/9ba9883f598f37bd84fb6890ea4d354f.png 200w,\n/static/a981d624617884c8c1ebaf18a8f4db22/497c6/9ba9883f598f37bd84fb6890ea4d354f.png 400w,\n/static/a981d624617884c8c1ebaf18a8f4db22/46604/9ba9883f598f37bd84fb6890ea4d354f.png 500w"}}}}},"pageContext":{"route":"/portfolio/pos-system"}}}
