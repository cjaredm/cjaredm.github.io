Don't be a stranger, feel free to reach out and say hello!\n[jared@cjaredm.com](mailto:jared@cjaredm.com?subject=Just%20saw%20your%20portfolio%20site)\n\nI am someone who takes things apart to see how each part works. I am a life-time learner with a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy and a Master's degree of Education in Instructional Design. I strive to learn how things work while also focusing on functionality and getting work done.\n\nMy passion is to create value in the world. I am rewarded when I see my work being used, appreciated and built upon. I one day wish to own my own SaaS company that provides tools for small businesses. I dream to hire and train young adults in software development and mentor others seeking the same rewarding career I already have.","email":"jared@cjaredm.com","siteName":"cJaredm"},"post":{"id":"Blog-posts_1","strapiId":1,"date":"April 09, 2019","title":"Hello World","synopsis":"Literally the first real blog post. Literally, as in writing.","content":"Hello World! Just figured out how to setup a Gatsby Blog. First attempt at using Gatsby. I unfortunately tried to do it the hard way, not using the start-blog they have. Got several errors with GraphQL not finding the markdown files… lame! So I restarted with the starter-blog and it was up and running crazy fast.\n\nI know this still looks like the same start-blog everyone has with Gatsby but I’ll come back and restyle it later."}},"pageContext":{"route":"/blog/hello-world"}}}
