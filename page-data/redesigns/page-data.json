Here are a few of them that were fun, interessting or just that I liked.\n\n### Q10 Capital\n\nFor this project I was given mocks of the new design for Q10 Capital, a national real estate company with lots of affialtes around the country, each having their own sub-site.\n\nI was given the liberty to do what I needed to get the redesign done, which means I explored new ways of doing things, like using GraphQL to get data from the database using WordPress's API and PHP. This was all new to me but super fun! Worked it out to get all kinds of custom post types from across all the multi-site, like recent transactions, employees, locations, etc. Advanced Custom Fields Pro was a life saver for making the custom post types and using GraphQL with WordPress.\n\nI also made some custom Google maps with icons for pointers, integreated some external APIs for getting interest rates, created lots of custom components for all the admins to use when updating their own content.\n\n### Bonney\nFor [Bonney.com](https://Bonney.com) I was again on my own and provided some mocks in Photoshop for what the new site was to look like. I had much less control on this project and had to make things exactly how the client wanted.\n\nOne of the interesting parts of this project was dealing with CCPA laws that require specific thing to be seen on the site and requirements for handling customer data.\n\n### YesUtah and YesIdaho\nFor these sites, [YesUtah.org](https://yesutah.org) and [YesIdaho.org](https://yesidaho.org), that are donor registeries for Utah and Idaho, I updated each with the same WordPress theme that I created from scratch. It allowed better backend management of the site for their user success stories, sign ups, and event handling.\n\nWhile on this project I was able to bring React into WordPress to use as components the editors and admins can use on their pages. Components like Images with text over them, styled in a particular way, specialized ddynamic sections for each pages and event displays.","techStack":[{"name":"WordPress","url":"https://wordpress.org/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/379f030b2726902ab74339fb8a07e582/69585/98a215a08fa3150386bfa3549e2970aa.png 200w,\n/static/379f030b2726902ab74339fb8a07e582/497c6/98a215a08fa3150386bfa3549e2970aa.png 400w,\n/static/379f030b2726902ab74339fb8a07e582/46604/98a215a08fa3150386bfa3549e2970aa.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"GraphQL","url":"https://graphql.org/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/dec2e9f1757366fd74825ed55cd5c47b/69585/f6ce5acd92674621c682a8b233a60bcc.png 200w,\n/static/dec2e9f1757366fd74825ed55cd5c47b/497c6/f6ce5acd92674621c682a8b233a60bcc.png 400w,\n/static/dec2e9f1757366fd74825ed55cd5c47b/46604/f6ce5acd92674621c682a8b233a60bcc.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"jQuery","url":"https://jquery.com/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/9e7c049ee67cc06a317b272c15f7b3e3/69585/6dc8c6b07ffaab8746c3c72c1e1f631e.png 200w,\n/static/9e7c049ee67cc06a317b272c15f7b3e3/497c6/6dc8c6b07ffaab8746c3c72c1e1f631e.png 400w,\n/static/9e7c049ee67cc06a317b272c15f7b3e3/46604/6dc8c6b07ffaab8746c3c72c1e1f631e.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"JavaScript","url":"https://www.javascript.com/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/871f85ae9d7c62f86642e54b86e5fbdf/69585/3bacd25edce404353a9f3a27305d4b01.png 200w,\n/static/871f85ae9d7c62f86642e54b86e5fbdf/497c6/3bacd25edce404353a9f3a27305d4b01.png 400w,\n/static/871f85ae9d7c62f86642e54b86e5fbdf/46604/3bacd25edce404353a9f3a27305d4b01.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"php","url":"https://www.php.net/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/de0bf5930830f44b012f32d589de1083/69585/031a3ca08bd7bca5e3930edc2c13ca44.png 200w,\n/static/de0bf5930830f44b012f32d589de1083/497c6/031a3ca08bd7bca5e3930edc2c13ca44.png 400w,\n/static/de0bf5930830f44b012f32d589de1083/46604/031a3ca08bd7bca5e3930edc2c13ca44.png 500w"}}}},{"name":"React","url":"https://reactjs.org/","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/09a31ed59b78c1d34190105782c6168c/69585/7f204f0ca8e0828d2a2f7c78229431aa.png 200w,\n/static/09a31ed59b78c1d34190105782c6168c/497c6/7f204f0ca8e0828d2a2f7c78229431aa.png 400w,\n/static/09a31ed59b78c1d34190105782c6168c/46604/7f204f0ca8e0828d2a2f7c78229431aa.png 500w"}}}}],"screenshot":{"name":"7760b92fff2436a56d0bb821a64e74e6","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"srcSet":"/static/6710b2d87389f6c359c3dccb17c467d3/69585/7760b92fff2436a56d0bb821a64e74e6.png 200w,\n/static/6710b2d87389f6c359c3dccb17c467d3/497c6/7760b92fff2436a56d0bb821a64e74e6.png 400w,\n/static/6710b2d87389f6c359c3dccb17c467d3/46604/7760b92fff2436a56d0bb821a64e74e6.png 500w"}}}}},"pageContext":{"route":"redesigns"}}}
