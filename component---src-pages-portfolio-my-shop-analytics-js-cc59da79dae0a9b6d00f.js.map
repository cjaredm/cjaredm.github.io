It\n          takes in orders made up of parts. Each part has a quantity that needs\n          to be made and run thru several machines, that process called\n          operations. I have a drag areas for each machine a part could be run\n          thru and places for pending and finished parts. Employees just log in\n          on their phones/computer and drag the part they are working on to the\n          machine they are using. They fill out some info and do the same when\n          they are done with it. Each operation gets time stamped and connected\n          to everything in the database so I can look up analytics for each\n          machine, employee, part, order, customer, etc.\n        </p>\n      </>\n    }\n  />\n);\n\nexport default MyShopAnalytics;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
