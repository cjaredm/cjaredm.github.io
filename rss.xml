&lt;p&gt;Read this with a grain of salt. It’s how I feel, so put your pitch fork down. I know that this isn’t 100% accurate and there are cases you could point at that prove that. Calm down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do the l33t use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently was talking to someone I’ve been teaching/mentoring. He was curious about the tools and methods I was showing him on how to make a web page. He assumed these tools and methods were not what the the professionals use, so he wanted to see how I actually do things.
As I was explaining things I realized, maybe not for the first time, that in my field, Frontend Development, we all basically are on the same level playing field. Free tools, open source libraries, all available to everyone, n00bs and l33ts the same (l33t is kinda annoying but it gets the point across).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code/Frameworks/Libraries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you want to write a book. What do you need, and is there anything you have to pay for? Well, you need to know the language you’re writing in. You need something to write on to save it… You get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to write some code or a program or whatever? Do you know the language? Guess what, it’s free. You don’t technically need to pay someone to teach you (though it can help). You don’t need to pay for a certificate or diploma. You don’t need to pay to gain access to the language or documentation on how to use it. It’s free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript/HTML/CSS, it’s all free and wildly documented all over the internet. You can make a webpage on your computer this moment using any text editor in like two minutes. Using any computer, anywhere. Nothing stopping anyone from doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies build things to help themselves and make it available free to the world. Facebook created React, a library for JavaScript that makes building interactive sites so easy. It’s just JavaScript but with pre-written helpers that you use to speed things up. Technically you could not use React and just use JavaScript to do the exact same thing, but React is easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AirBnB made some JavaScript testing tools. Other people make tools and just publish for everyone to use. Things like EsLint, Prettier, lodash, styled-components. All free for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Editors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several free code editors out there. Do you need one? Nope., but think of the difference writing a paper for school in the basic text editor on your computer versus using Microsoft Word. Word picks up on spelling errors and shows them to you. It has all kinds of editing options and tools specific for writing documents that a normal plain text editor doesn’t have. Same goes for writing code. Technically you could use Vim, the text editor built i to your terminal(command line) on your computer. But that would be hell! So people made editors specific to the languages of code you write in to be able to pick up on mistakes and makes writing faster and easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two big ones are VS Code and Sublime Text. I follow Wes Bos fairly closely, he makes awesome tutorials for JavaScript and React. Because he does tutorials for anyone wanting to learn he wants to make the learning focused on the topic, not the tools, and doesn’t want you to have you to have to pay for extra stuff, which is why he uses VS Code. Very awesome free editor. Very good for paid programming since you can collaborate on  specific project with someone anywhere else in the world. I’ve used it a few times and it has been awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my work they pay for us to use WebStorm and PhpStorm, editors made by JetBrains. I found that because I have a masters degree my college gives my my .edu email for life. It so happens that the easier way to prove you are a student is to have a .edu email from a big college and that means student discounts or free stuff. I have WebStorm for free with their student program. It does a few things the free editors can’t or haven’t added yet, but VS Code is adding things all the time and can do many things WebStorm can’t. The idea is that, it doesn’t matter though. I don’t need to pay for an editor to code something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Version Control / Backups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing code is basically just some text documents, usually doesn’t take up a lot of storage on your computer. But, it’s a good idea to keep it somewhere accessible and saved off your computer. You might think of other storage places like DropBox and GoogleDrive but that may eventually cost you as well, as you make a lot of projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comes places like GitHub and GitBucket and another one… git labs maybe? They use command line interface (CLI) which, you guessed it, is free, called git. Git is used for version control and backing things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing a paper for school have you saved it (KittensPaper) duplicated it and made changes to the duplicate? Then you save that with a different name, like  FinalKittensPaper. You are versioning your papers. Labeling them to help and making duplicates in case one is deleted or corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what git does,  but for code. It lets you keep the good code on a branch while you make a new branch to try changing that code. If you changes are good you can merge them into the good branch and do it again. And those places like GitHub make it so you can save them online, for free, and show them to others and even have others use your code in their projects. That is where you can download all those libraries I was talking about earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More than one way to skin a cat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another awesome thing about programming is that you can create the same thing in a myriad of ways. You can use differe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ways may be worse/better than others  but that is the idea. You can do it your own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing that any computer right now could be used to create just about anything in code. You could download some free software, like code editors to make it easier,  but you don’t have to. You could use some libraries other people have written for free,  but you don’t have to. You can save it online for free, but you don’t have to. Right now you can code anything anyone else could code, you could create any website just like any other company or person could, in the world. The only difference is what you and they know about programming languages, which again, you could learn for free online. We developers are on a level playing field. It is awesome to know I can pick up any language I desire at any time. I can make a website just as good as a big corporation, if I had the motivation to. I am the only thing stopping me from learning how.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Start Side Projects]]></title><description><![CDATA[Published: May 29, 2019 I feel like it is important keep doing personal projects to keep learning new things.

&lt;p&gt;I feel like it is important keep doing personal projects to keep learning new things. Keep doing tutorials and using new libraries to find what’s good and bad. What’s even better is making things that are useful or someone else might want. I try and find a need and fill it while I learn something new. It gives me motivation to not abandon the project when I get bored or whatever that makes us give up and not finish a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Find Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start small&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up with ideas can be hard. Sometimes I feel like I am suppose to come up with some new business idea that is totally unique and will make me tons of money. Just stop thinking like that, right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started build extremely small things that you find useful. Before I really knew what programming was I was into spreadsheets, a lot. I found that Google Drive has its own script language you can use to interact with everything in your drive. Also, I know that every cell phone number has an email specific to the carrier it is on. So I made a spreadsheet with names, birthdays messages and phone numbers with carriers. Then I wrote a script that would check each day at 7 AM if today is someone’s birthday and then email their special carrier email that texts it to them from my google account. I’ll always be the first to message someone ‘Happy birthday’ on their birthday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, stupid project but easy and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a similar setup to make a Lease Ending Reminder script that emails a customer the month before their lease is up on their home. Did that for a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another friend had a problem with having to fill out a bunch of contracts with contractor/vendor information. Difficult to fill out over and over. So I made a google sheets script that you fill in pertinent info and it takes a template contract, searches for variable names I setup in it and replaces them with the info from the sheet. Easy peasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Talk To Friends&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that some projects above came from friends. If you can’t find a need in your life then ask friends. I have come up with great ideas from friends. Found they with something existed, or worked better, or that they didn’t need to do this or that. Pick something and start small. Fix just part of it. Then add to it. Make it better. Add a feature. Keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine with a machine shop had an issue tracking orders and parts he is making. Another owns a store but their POS system doesn’t work well. My brother’s business needed an employee and job time tracking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a need and fill it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MVP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start SMALL! Make the minimum viable product (MVP) that someone could use.  Get it in use, put it in someone’s hands. Get feedback. If they aren’t excited about it or have ideas on what they wish it could do then try another idea. The idea is if you make the smallest viable project and people aren’t excited about the possibilities then probably not the best idea to continue. If you have to quit something, the earlier you do it the better. Less wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you want to hear is things like, “Can you get it to do ‘X’?”. When someone sees its use and immediately is hoping it can do more things then it’s a sign they’d use it. If they don’t see anything else they hope out of it, remembering that it is a minimum viable product, then no, you didn’t make it perfectly. They just don’t see themselves using it. Brain turns off and moves on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complete Something&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, and most other people that code, you’ll likely start lots of projects and never finish them. I have 3 portfolio sites, several other blogs, a movie app, and who knows what else, that I never fully finished. You need to finish things. At least now and then push a product all the way thru. Deploy, ship, whatever. Get it online, or being used. It looks better on a portfolio site as well. Show off things that work and are done. You get the idea. Just finish something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disproportionate Enthusiasm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention I’ve made some small things for friends. I even made a large app for a friend as well. I was stoked, excited, extremely anxious to see how my projects turned out and how much they’d help my friends. Took so much time figuring out the problem, learned something new to solve it, and made it look nice. I give it to my friend to use and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing. I hear nothing back. I wait. Days go by. Nothing. Why aren’t they telling me how awesome it is? Maybe it is broke? If it were broke the. Why didn’t then tell me so I could fix it? Maybe I should contact them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all leads to me finding out they ghosted me. Some of them just never responded to me on Facebook again. Some did but said they haven’t used it yet. And after waiting I find they never did use it. Not sure if they were scared to try a new system or thought it was crap. But they never even tried to use it and find out. So frustrating, but very common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Take Away&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make projects! Lots of them. Learn new tech while you do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make their scope small. Smaller than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get people using them and get feedback. If they don’t have excited suggestions then quit and move on. Quit projects early or finish them all the way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete a project 💯%!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How I Got Started]]></title><description><![CDATA[TLDR I got degrees in things that gave me debt and no real job I loved. Got sick, literally sick, at my job and

&lt;p&gt;I got degrees in things that gave me debt and no real job I loved. Got sick, literally sick, at my job and
decided it was time to figure something out. A friend mentored me and within 4 months I got my first dev job!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Extended History&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a bunch of money I didn’t have and received a BA in Philosophy. It was fun!
Learned to think more logically and get new perspective… BUT didn’t get me a job. Still fun though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I got married, had a kid and decided that maybe… maybe I should do something to
make enough money for a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved learning and wished I could just keep going to college etc. So what I decided was to
get a master’s degree in Educational Technology, also known as Instructional Design. I’d be
able to create trainings, on everything. So I’d keep learning everything as I made different
things for different people. In fact I did some freelancing for awhile and made trainings for
pest control technicians, an online MBA program in Australia, and a cooking course in an
applied technical college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT… alas that didn’t last long. It seems that most people in my cohort in my MEd. program
already had a job in training and were getting education to move up in their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I spent a bunch of money I didn’t have… again, to get that MEd.

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also was working for Apple doing tech support part time. Eventually I did that full time… and grew to… dislike
it, to put it in nice words. It wasn’t hard, but it was boring and I didn’t fit the culture at the time. Wasn’t very
fulfilling (to me that is). I was even getting anxious and stomach aches thinking about going
to work. Dreading it every day. I wanted and needed to get out of there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all that time I was messing around with spreadsheets and getting deeper and deeper in
Google App Script making silly things. Made a spreadsheet with birthdays that a script would
check every day around 7 AM, and text a special message I wrote to the birthday person. Super
cool, huh? I also made a spreadsheet script for emailing people to remind them when their
lease was ending, their new lease amount and other templated information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Moment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was having fun doing that and getting stomach aches before going to work at a dead end
job. Then BAM! My friend Kasey saw what I was doing with spreadsheets and scripts and pushed
me to learn how to code. My wife and I talked about it and I convinced her to go to work full
time while I paid a baby sitter to watch the kids while I learned how to code with some
guidance from my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 4 months later I won! I got a job with my friend’s company because I convinced them I
wasn’t a jerk and was a fast learner. YAY! There was probably some other technical stuff I
showed them too, but yeah. I did it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Now&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, 2 year later. Learned a ton more. I’m building React Native apps along
with all the other normal, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, PHP, and blah or whatever. I’ve also
found that I want to help other people. I started looking for people to help and mentor into
JavaScript. It has been fun! Met some nice people and have really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been looking for more ways to help mentor others and keep learning. This blog will talk
about it. Keep checking in.

Just figured out how to setup a Gatsby Blog. First attempt at using Gatsby.
I unfortunately tried to do it the hard way, not using the start-blog they have. Got several errors with GraphQL not finding the markdown files… lame!
So I restarted with the starter-blog and it was up and running crazy fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this still looks like the same start-blog everyone has with Gatsby but I’ll come back and
restyle it later.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
