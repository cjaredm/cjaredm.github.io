It was fun! Learned to think more logically and get new perspective… BUT didn’t get me a job. Still fun though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I got married, had a kid and decided that maybe… maybe I should do something to make enough money for a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved learning and wished I could just keep going to college etc. So what I decided was to get a master’s degree in Educational Technology, also known as Instructional Design. I’d be able to create trainings, on everything. So I’d keep learning everything as I made different things for different people. In fact I did some freelancing for awhile and made trainings for pest control technicians, an online MBA program in Australia, and a cooking course in an applied technical college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT… alas that didn’t last long. It seems that most people in my cohort in my MEd. program already had a job in training and were getting education to move up in their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I spent a bunch of money I didn’t have, again, to get that MEd. I also was working for Apple doing tech support part time. Eventually I did that full time… and grew to… dislike it, to put it in nice words. It wasn’t hard, it was a little too repetitive, and not very fulfilling (to me that is). I wanted and needed to get out of there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all that time I was messing around with spreadsheets and getting deeper and deeper in Google App Script making silly things. Made a spreadsheet with birthdays that a script would check every day around 7 AM, and text a special message I wrote to the birthday person. Super cool, huh? I also made a spreadsheet script for emailing people to remind them when their lease was ending, their new lease amount and other templated information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was having fun doing that and getting stomach aches before going to work at a dead end job. Then BAM! My friend Kasey saw what I was doing with spreadsheets and scripts and pushed me to learn how to code. My wife and I talked about it and I convinced her to go to work full time while I paid a baby sitter to watch the kids while I learned how to code with some guidance from my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 4 months later I won! I got a job with my friend’s company because I convinced them I wasn’t a jerk and was a fast learner. YAY! There was probably some other technical stuff I showed them too, but yeah. I did it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, 1 year later. Learned a ton more. I’m building React Native apps along with all the other normal, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, PHP, and blah or whatever. I’ve also found that I want to help other people. I started looking for people to help and mentor into JavaScript. It has been fun! Met some nice people and have really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been looking for more ways to help mentor others and keep learning. This blog will talk about it. Keep checking in.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hello World! Just figured out how to setup a Gatsby Blog.

Just figured out how to setup a Gatsby Blog. Firs attempt at using gatsby.
I unfortunately tried to do it the hard way, not using the start-blog they have. Got several errors with GraphQL not finding the markdown files… lame!
So I restarted with the starter-blog and it was up and running crazy fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this still looks like the same start-blog everyone has with Gatsby but I’ll come back and
restyle it later.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
