I deployed my first ever version 1 project. I’ve started
many projects before but hadn’t pushed thru to get them published and live.
This time I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/pVM4xuseBY0oIcK2Yp/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;I did it!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s the story?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I had been looking for projects to build, maybe something that would
end up making me money. I asked several family and friends for ideas. I
listened to podcasts about side hustles and these types of projects, or
start-ups. I found that most often they stumble into a good business idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance there was a story of a company making software for plumbers to
find customers. They made a great project and had businesses trying to
use them but many were back out and disappear. They decided to look into how
these businesses were using their product. They found that these small
businesses were struggling with other things and would end up bailing on
their product or not giving it enough attention. Their main issue was
organizing themselves and tracking paper work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business pivoted and focused on helping small businesses with their
paperwork and tracking. They became a huge success after stumbling onto
the need of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I was trying to do. I found a friend that has a manufacturing
business as a machine shop machining parts from metals. He told me they
have poor order/part tracking and would love to have something simple.
Of course that kind of software already exists but not specific to his
industry that also doesn’t have a ton of things he doesn’t want to pay for.
I worked on it for the last 3-4 months and finally deployed a week ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built a a customized version of a kanban board specific to his shop/industry.
Pretty simple at first glance, a drag and drop list of todos with specific
machines to do them on and a finished section. I built on that idea and
features as I went. Soon I’ll have analytics built in so that he can look
back and see what employees are working the most efficiently, what customers
provide the most profits, what parts are loosing them money, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He already started showing his team and will start utilizing it next week.
Because it was a success he brought me another idea of an app to build for
his sisters company that they’ll pay for in full, where this current project
I own and will be charging for monthly and start selling to other shops.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How I Got Started]]></title><description><![CDATA[TLDR I got degrees in things that gave me debt and no real job I loved. Got sick, literally sick, at my job and

&lt;p&gt;I got degrees in things that gave me debt and no real job I loved. Got sick, literally sick, at my job and
decided it was time to figure something out. A friend mentored me and within 4 months I got my first dev job!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Extended History&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a bunch of money I didn’t have and received a BA in Philosophy. It was fun!
Learned to think more logically and get new perspective… BUT didn’t get me a job. Still fun though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I got married, had a kid and decided that maybe… maybe I should do something to
make enough money for a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved learning and wished I could just keep going to college etc. So what I decided was to
get a master’s degree in Educational Technology, also known as Instructional Design. I’d be
able to create trainings, on everything. So I’d keep learning everything as I made different
things for different people. In fact I did some freelancing for awhile and made trainings for
pest control technicians, an online MBA program in Australia, and a cooking course in an
applied technical college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT… alas that didn’t last long. It seems that most people in my cohort in my MEd. program
already had a job in training and were getting education to move up in their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I spent a bunch of money I didn’t have… again, to get that MEd.

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also was working for Apple doing tech support part time. Eventually I did that full time… and grew to… dislike
it, to put it in nice words. It wasn’t hard, but it was boring and I didn’t fit the culture at the time. Wasn’t very
fulfilling (to me that is). I was even getting anxious and stomach aches thinking about going
to work. Dreading it every day. I wanted and needed to get out of there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all that time I was messing around with spreadsheets and getting deeper and deeper in
Google App Script making silly things. Made a spreadsheet with birthdays that a script would
check every day around 7 AM, and text a special message I wrote to the birthday person. Super
cool, huh? I also made a spreadsheet script for emailing people to remind them when their
lease was ending, their new lease amount and other templated information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Moment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was having fun doing that and getting stomach aches before going to work at a dead end
job. Then BAM! My friend Kasey saw what I was doing with spreadsheets and scripts and pushed
me to learn how to code. My wife and I talked about it and I convinced her to go to work full
time while I paid a baby sitter to watch the kids while I learned how to code with some
guidance from my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 4 months later I won! I got a job with my friend’s company because I convinced them I
wasn’t a jerk and was a fast learner. YAY! There was probably some other technical stuff I
showed them too, but yeah. I did it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Now&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, 2 year later. Learned a ton more. I’m building React Native apps along
with all the other normal, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, PHP, and blah or whatever. I’ve also
found that I want to help other people. I started looking for people to help and mentor into
JavaScript. It has been fun! Met some nice people and have really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been looking for more ways to help mentor others and keep learning. This blog will talk
about it. Keep checking in.

Just figured out how to setup a Gatsby Blog. First attempt at using Gatsby.
I unfortunately tried to do it the hard way, not using the start-blog they have. Got several errors with GraphQL not finding the markdown files… lame!
So I restarted with the starter-blog and it was up and running crazy fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this still looks like the same start-blog everyone has with Gatsby but I’ll come back and
restyle it later.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
